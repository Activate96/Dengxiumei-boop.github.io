<p align="justify"> I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at the Singapore University of Technology and Design, supervised by <a href = "https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=n4CH4M4AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao"><b>Prof. Zehui Xiong</b></a>. I received the Ph.D. degree in Information and Communications Engineering from Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China, in 2024, supervised by <a href = "https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pg2qGzQAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN"><b>Prof. Jun Li</b></a>. Before that, I received the B.E. degree from Nanjing University of Science and Technology, in 2018. From Jan. 2018 to Jun., I was an exchange student at Technical University of Munich, Germany, supervised by <a href = "https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=dCvUPdoAAAAJ&hl=de"><b>Prof. Thomas F. Eibert</b></a>. </p>

<p align="justify"> My research interests mainly focus on distributed machine learning, network optimization, and blockchain technologies. </p>
